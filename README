## grimoire from Bor Kraljiƒç <pyrobor[at]ver[dot]si>
#---

Core scripts like FUNCTIONS are copied from test grimoire. That way
writting of the spells is simpler. I try to keep the last version of those.

== Spells that are suppose to be working ==

* qmmp - Qt-based Multimedia Player (http://qmmp.ylsoftware.com/)
* urtsb - Game Server Browser for the FPS Urban Terror (http://code.google.com/p/urtsb/)
* qtscrob - QTScrobbler to last.fm (http://qtscrob.sourceforge.net/)
* mlt  - only small modifications to the one in test grimoire
* clementine - audio player similar to amarok1.4 (http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/)
* pdfgrep - tool to search text in PDF files (http://pdfgrep.sourceforge.net/)

== Maybe broken ==

* ggl - google gadgets for Linux (http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux/)
* qtemu - QtEmu is a graphical user interface for QEMU (http://qtemu.org/)
* openshot: http://www.openshot.org/
* gpsbabel: http://www.gpsbabel.org/
* urt-mitsubishi - Optimized executable for UrT (http://www.www0.org/w/Optimized_executable%3b_builds_of_ioq3_engine_for_urt)
* molsketch - program for drawing molecular structures (http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/molsKetch?content=54819)
* bkchem -  A chemical drawing program (http://bkchem.zirael.org/index.html)
* axel - A light and advanced downloader for the Unix console (http://freshmeat.net/projects/axel/)
* lightspark - a modern, free, open-source flash player implementation (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lightspark)

== not working ==

* virtualbox-bin - virtualbox (not OSE version) (http://www.virtualbox.org/)
* testspell - simple spell for testing that doesn't install anything

Other spells are probably not working.

If you have any spells in your local grimoire I encurage you to somehow submit it.
This way could other benefit from it too.
(Didn't explore the github to that level but I am sure there is a simple way)

To add it simply use scribe:
scribe add pyrogrimoire from git://github.com/PyroBor/pyrogrimoire.git
