## grimoire from Bor Kraljiƒç <pyrobor[at]ver[dot]si>
#---

Core scripts like FUNCTIONS are copied from test grimoire. That way
writting of the spells is simpler. I try to keep the last version of those.

Spells that are suppose to be working:

* qmmp http://qmmp.ylsoftware.com/ 
* urtsb http://code.google.com/p/urtsb/
* qtscrob http://qtscrob.sourceforge.net/
* mlt  - only small modifications to the one in test grimoire
* python-geoip: http://www.maxmind.com/app/python

Maybe working:

* frei0r-plugins: http://www.piksel.org/frei0r
* openshot: http://www.openshot.org/

Other spells are probably not working.

If you have any spells in your local grimoire I encurage you to somehow submit it.
This way could other benefit from it too.
(Didn't explore the github to that level but I am sure there is a simple way)

To add it simply use scribe:
scribe add pyrogrimoire from git://github.com/PyroBor/pyrogrimoire.git
