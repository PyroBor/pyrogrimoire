cat << EOF
bimobiledevice is a software library that talks the protocols to support
iPhone®, iPod Touch®, iPad® and Apple TV® devices. Unlike other projects,
it does not depend on using any existing proprietary libraries and does not
require jailbreaking. It allows other software to easily access the device's
filesystem, retrieve information about the device and it's internals,
backup/restore the device, manage SpringBoard® icons, manage installed
applications, retrieve addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks and
(using libgpod) synchronize music and video to the device. The library is
in development since August 2007 with the goal to bring support for these
devices to the Linux Desktop.
