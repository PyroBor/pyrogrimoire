cat << EOF
Google Gadgets for Linux provides a platform for running Google Gadgets under
Linux, catering to the unique needs of Linux users. It's compatible with
the gadgets written for Google Desktop for Windows as well as the Universal
Gadgets on iGoogle. There are two main components to the application: one
is a common gadget library responsible for running and presenting a gadget,
and the other is a host program that allows the user to choose gadgets and run
them on the desktop. Currently it has hosts written for GTK+ and Qt, with the
GTK+ host offering a sidebar similiar to that of Google Desktop for Windows.
