molsKetch is a program for drawing molecular structures, in the spirit of
Chemsketch and xdrawchem, for all platforms supported by Qt 4. As for now
it supports drawing a basic carbon skeleton, adding hetero atoms and charge
and different types of bonds. The resulting structure can be exported to
all formats supported by the OpenBabel library and can also be exported as
SVG or bitmap. For a full overview of the features see below.
