Frei0r is a minimalistic plugin API for video sources and filters. The
behaviour of the effects can be controlled from the host by simple
parameters. The intent is to solve the recurring reimplementation or adaptation
issue of standard effects.

Frei0r is not meant as a generic API for all kinds of video applications.

There is no support for the requirements of special application areas like
non linear editors, hardware accelerated shader effects, and high precision
video processing. These advanced issues are not even solved satisfactory
for non cross application plugin apis and are still an evolving field.

The frei0r API is not meant to be a competing standard to more ambitious
efforts
